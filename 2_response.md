The data displays the energy consumption over various half-years from 2015H1 to 2023H2 across five different consumption categories. Here are some trends observed:

1. **Overall Increase**:
   - All consumption categories show a steady increase over time. For instance, Consumption_1 rose from 3000 KWH in 2015H1 to 4100 KWH in 2023H2.
   - This general upward trend suggests a growing demand for energy across all categories.

2. **Category-Specific Trends**:
   - **Consumption_1**: Shows a consistent increase each half-year, indicating steady growth in this category.
   - **Consumption_2**: Also increases consistently but at a slightly slower rate compared to Consumption_1.
   - **Consumption_3**: Has the highest consumption values, suggesting this category has the greatest energy needs. Its growth is steady and mirrors the overall pattern.
   - **Consumption_4**: Shows steady growth similar to other categories, with a smaller base compared to Consumption_3.
   - **Consumption_5**: The lowest consumption values among all categories, but it still shows a steady increase.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - The rate of increase in Consumption_1, Consumption_3, and Consumption_5 is relatively similar, with slight variations in the absolute values.
   - Consumption_3 consistently remains the highest, followed by Consumption_1, Consumption_2, Consumption_4, and Consumption_5.

These trends indicate an overall increase in energy consumption across all categories, reflecting perhaps economic growth, population increase, or other factors driving energy demand.
